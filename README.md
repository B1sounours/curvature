# Curvature
Curvature is a full-featured Utility-based AI editor and sandbox tool.

The project is intended to provide a complete playground for creating, editing, and testing decision-making AI. Under the hood, Curvature uses *Utility Theory* to model the appeal of various behaviors. Specifically, Curvature is based on the Infinite Axis Utility System by Dave Mark. Curvature builds on the IAUS approach and includes enhancements and refinements developed during work on *Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns*.

Curvature is fully data-driven and supports the creation of a complete AI pipeline, from the core knowledge-base accessed by agents, to the specific *considerations* that drive the scoring of individual behaviors. The goal is to deliver an end-to-end solution for modeling and testing AI, including a simple world representation that allows designers or AI programmers to place agents in a virtual space and see how they would choose to behave.

# Project Status
Curvature is still in early development. Check back frequently for new features and enhancements.

Some things I'm hoping to add:
 * Richer knowledge-base implementation
 * Better parameterization of input axes
 * Experimentation UI for agent archetypes
 * World "scenarios" for setting up test scenes
 * Multi-agent experimentation mode (part of scenarios)
